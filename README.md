# Univariate data analysis

Analysis of several features of [NASA Lunar Eclipses](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/LEcatkey.html) dataset. 

Analysis incudes:
- Non-parametric estimation of probability density function in form of histogram using kernel density function.
- Estimation of order statistics represented as box with whiskers plot. 
- Determining one or several distributions that could describe data.
- Parameter estimation of random variable distribution using maximum likelihood technique and least squares methods.
- Validation of empirical and theoretical distributions using quantile biplots.
- Estimation of correctness of fitted distributions using statistical tests.
